Hi everyone, I am Santhosh.  
This is Meals App project and it is used for searching different types of meals.
In this, I have integrated backend with an API called 'The MealDB Api'.
You can search any cuisine in the world using this meals app and if you want you can also add it to favorite list.
I have added a separate page to show favorite items. You can add and remove any food item at any time. I used localStorage to store the data.
I built this app using HTML, CSS and  JavaScript.
I have added different styles to my app and you can also use the detail button to see the instruction of how the food was made.
Creating a meals app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves designing the user interface, handling user interactions, and potentially connecting to a backend for data storage and retrieval.
